# 1-1. Exploring python.org

While browsing Python.org, I found several interesting sections:

- **Downloads** → Provides the latest Python versions for different operating systems.
- **Documentation** → Official guides for beginners and advanced users.
- **Community** → A place to find Python communities, events, and news.
- **Success Stories** → Articles on how Python is used in real-world industries.
- **PEP (Python Enhancement Proposals)** → Explains how Python evolves.

The most interesting section for me is **"Documentation"**, as it allows me to learn Python features directly from the official source.
