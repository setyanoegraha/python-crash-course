# 1-3. Infinite Skills â€“ What Would I Build?

If I had infinite programming skills, I would build:

- **Automated OSINT Toolkit** â†’ A tool to efficiently gather and analyze open-source intelligence (OSINT).
- **Cybersecurity Training Platform** â†’ An interactive web-based system for penetration testing and cybersecurity practice.
- **AI-Powered Malware Analyzer** â†’ An AI-driven system to detect and analyze malware automatically.

These projects align with my interests in OSINT, malware development, and web penetration testing. ðŸš€
