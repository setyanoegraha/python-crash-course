Explanation:

1Ô∏è‚É£ The program begins by printing a statement informing us that due to the discovery of a bigger table, four more guests are being invited to dinner.
2Ô∏è‚É£ We define the first additional guest as 'andera' and insert their name at the beginning of the 'guests' list using `.insert()`.
3Ô∏è‚É£ We print a message confirming that 'andera' has been added as the first additional guest.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The second additional guest 'kana' is defined and inserted at the 4th position in the list (index 4) using `.insert()`.
5Ô∏è‚É£ We print a message confirming 'kana' as the second additional guest.
6Ô∏è‚É£ The third additional guest 'yulensky' is defined and added to the 5th position of the list (index 5) using `.insert()`.
7Ô∏è‚É£ A message is printed confirming 'yulensky' as the third additional guest.
8Ô∏è‚É£ The last additional guest 'anwar' is added at the end of the list using `.append()`.
9Ô∏è‚É£ A message is printed confirming 'anwar' as the last additional guest.
üîü The updated guest list is printed. A personalized dinner invitation is sent to each guest in the updated list using a loop and formatted strings, displaying the details of the event (date, location, and table number).

‚úÖ Key concepts:
    - **List Manipulation:** `.insert()` adds elements at specific positions in the list, and `.append()` adds an element to the end of the list.
    - **String Formatting:** We use f-strings to format the names and print personalized messages.
    - **Looping:** The program generates invitation messages for each guest in the updated list.
    - **List Indexing:** Inserting guests at specific positions using indexes.

üöÄ This method is useful for dynamically updating a guest list and sending personalized invitations based on new circumstances.
