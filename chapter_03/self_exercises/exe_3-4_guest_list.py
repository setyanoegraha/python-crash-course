Explanation:

1Ô∏è‚É£ We define a list called `guests`, which contains eight names of friends.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Each `print()` statement generates a personalized dinner invitation.
3Ô∏è‚É£ `f-strings` are used to insert the guest's name dynamically into the invitation text.
4Ô∏è‚É£ `.title()` is applied to each guest's name to ensure proper capitalization.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Negative indexing (`guests[-1]`) is used to access the last element (`gargan`).
6Ô∏è‚É£ The invitations are formatted with `\n` to create line breaks for better readability.

‚úÖ Key concepts demonstrated:
   - **Lists:** Storing multiple names in an ordered sequence.
   - **String Methods:** `.title()` capitalizes the first letter of each name.
   - **Formatted Strings (f-strings):** Dynamic string interpolation for better readability.
   - **Indexing:** Using both positive (`guests[0]`) and negative (`guests[-1]`) indexing.
   
üìù This snippet showcases list operations and string formatting to generate multiple personalized messages efficiently.
