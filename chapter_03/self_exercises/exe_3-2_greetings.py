1Ô∏è‚É£ We create a list named `names` that contains five lowercase names.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Each `print()` statement displays a personalized message for one name.
3Ô∏è‚É£ We use `names[index].title()` to capitalize the first letter of each name.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The `f-string()` (formatted string) dynamically inserts the names into the message.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The same message is repeated for each name, but with proper capitalization.

‚úÖ Key concepts in this exercise:
   - **Lists:** We store multiple names in an ordered collection.
   - **String Methods:** `.title()` capitalizes the first letter of each name.
   - **Formatted Strings (f-strings):** Allow dynamic insertion of variables into a string.
   - **Indexing:** Each name is accessed via its position in the list.

üìù While this code works correctly, it could be optimized using a loop to reduce redundancy. However, for learning purposes, this approach clearly shows how to access and format list elements individually.
