Explanation:

1Ô∏è‚É£ We create a list called `transportations` containing six vehicle names.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Each `print()` statement constructs a sentence using one element from the list.
3Ô∏è‚É£ String formatting (`f-strings`) is used to insert vehicle names dynamically.
4Ô∏è‚É£ `.upper()` is applied to the first element (`transportations[0]`) to convert it to uppercase.
5Ô∏è‚É£ `.title()` is used on other elements to capitalize the first letter of each word.
6Ô∏è‚É£ Negative indexing (`transportations[-1]`) is used to access the last item (`maserati`).

‚úÖ Key concepts in this exercise:
   - **Lists:** Store multiple vehicle names in an ordered sequence.
   - **String Methods:** `.upper()` capitalizes all letters, `.title()` capitalizes the first letter.
   - **Formatted Strings (f-strings):** Allow inserting variables dynamically into sentences.
   - **Indexing:** Both positive (`transportations[0]`) and negative (`transportations[-1]`) indexing are demonstrated.

üìù This snippet creatively applies list indexing and string manipulation to express preferences about different vehicles.
