Explanation:

1Ô∏è‚É£ We declare two variables: `first_name` and `last_name` to store a person's name.
2Ô∏è‚É£ We create `full_name` using an **f-string** (formatted string) to combine first and last names.
3Ô∏è‚É£ We print `full_name` to display the full name.
4Ô∏è‚É£ We use `full_name.title()` to format the name in title case before displaying a greeting.
5Ô∏è‚É£ We store the greeting message in a variable `message` and print it.

‚úÖ Key concepts in this exercise:
   - **String concatenation using f-strings (`f"{var}"`)** for cleaner, more readable formatting.
   - **Using `.title()` to capitalize the first letter of each word** for better presentation.
   - **Storing formatted strings in variables** for reuse and better program organization.

üìå This is useful for dynamically generating and formatting user messages, such as in chat applications or automated responses.
