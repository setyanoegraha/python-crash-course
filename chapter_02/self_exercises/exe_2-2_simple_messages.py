# Assign a message to a variable
message = "Don't give up on the life you promised yourself."

# Print out the message
print(message)

# Change the value of the variable
message = "Instead of focusing on being the best, just focus on being slightly better each and every day."

# Print out the new message
print(message)

"""
Explanation:

1. We declare a variable `message` and assign it a string value.
2. The `print(message)` statement outputs the initial value of `message`.
3. We then update the `message` variable by assigning a new string to it.
4. When we call `print(message)` again, it displays the new value.

✅ Key concepts in this exercise:
   - **Variable assignment:** We store text (a string) in a variable.
   - **Updating a variable:** A variable's value can be changed at any time.
   - **Printing variables:** We use `print()` to display the current value of `message`.

📝 This is useful for beginners to understand how variables work and how they can be modified during program execution.
