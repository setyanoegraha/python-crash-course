# Calculate the favorite number by subtracting 226 from 1000
fav_num = 1000 - 226

# Create a message using an f-string to include the calculated number
message = f"What is your favorite number? mine is {fav_num}."

# Print out the message
print(message)

"""
Explanation
1️⃣ Variable Assignment (fav_num)

fav_num = 1000 - 226

This calculates 774 and assigns it to fav_num.

2️⃣ Formatted String (f-string)

The message variable stores a formatted string.

f"What is your favorite number? Mine is {fav_num}." dynamically inserts fav_num into the string.

3️⃣ Print Output

What is your favorite number? Mine is 774.

✅ Key Concepts:

Mathematical Operations: Performing calculations within variable assignment.

String Formatting: Using f-strings to embed variables in strings.

Code Readability: Keeping variable names meaningful for clarity.
