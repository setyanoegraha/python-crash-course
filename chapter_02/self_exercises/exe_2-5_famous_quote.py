# Assign a value to the variable 'quote'
quote = "Friedrich Nietzsche once said, \"He who fights with monsters should look to it that he himself doesn't become a monster.\""

# Print out the output with identation and new line
print(f"\n\t{quote}")

"""
Explanation:

1Ô∏è‚É£ We store a quote from Friedrich Nietzsche in the `quote` variable.
2Ô∏è‚É£ The quote contains **escaped double quotes** (`\"`) to ensure it's printed correctly.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The `\n` at the start creates a **new line**, and `\t` adds an **indentation** before the text.
4Ô∏è‚É£ This formatting improves readability when printed in the terminal.

‚úÖ Key concepts in this exercise:
   - **String assignment:** Storing a famous quote inside a variable.
   - **Escape characters:** Using `\"` to include double quotes inside a string.
   - **Formatting strings:** Adding `\n` (new line) and `\t` (indentation).

üìå Useful when displaying quotes in a structured and visually appealing way.
