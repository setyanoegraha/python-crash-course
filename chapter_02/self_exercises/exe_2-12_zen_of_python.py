# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
# ---------------------------------

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Code should be aesthetically pleasing, not messy.

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explicit is better than implicit.
# Write code that is clear and understandable.

# Example:
x = "123"
y = int(x)  # Converting string to integer (Explicit)

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Simple is better than complex.
# Prefer straightforward solutions instead of over-engineering.

# Example:


def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b  # Simple approach

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Complex is better than complicated.
# If something must be complex, structure it properly.

# 5Ô∏è‚É£ Flat is better than nested.
# Avoid deep nesting of loops and conditionals.


# Example:
if condition1 and condition2 and condition3:
    print("More readable!")

# 6Ô∏è‚É£ Sparse is better than dense.
# Use proper spacing; don't cram everything into one line.

# Example:


def func(a, b):
    return a + b  # Readable code

# 7Ô∏è‚É£ Readability counts.
# The most important principle: your code should be easy to read.


# Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total = sum(numbers)
print(total)  # Clear and readable

# 8Ô∏è‚É£ Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Stick to consistent coding patterns.

# 9Ô∏è‚É£ Although practicality beats purity.
# Be pragmatic‚Äîsometimes breaking a rule is okay for efficiency.

# üîü Errors should never pass silently.
# Handle errors properly instead of ignoring them.

# Example:
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")

# 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Unless explicitly silenced.
# If ignoring an error, do it intentionally.

# Example:
try:
    risky_operation()
except Exception as e:
    log_error(e)  # Log instead of failing silently

# 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# Clarify unclear code instead of assuming.

# Example:
if user_input == "confirm":
    proceed()  # Clear condition

# 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Python encourages a single, clear solution.

# Example:
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)  # ‚úÖ Standard approach

# 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# A joke about Guido van Rossum, Python‚Äôs creator.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Now is better than never.
# Start coding instead of waiting for perfection.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Although never is often better than *right* now.
# Avoid rushing into bad decisions.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# Code should be easy to understand.

# Example:


def double(a):
    return a * 2  # Easy to explain

# 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Simple, readable solutions are usually the best.

# 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
# Namespaces prevent variable conflicts.


# Example:
print(math.sqrt(25))  # Using the 'math' namespace prevents conflicts
