# Assign a message to the variable
message = "Focus on consistency not intensity. Progress comes from showing up daily."

# Print out the message
print(message)

"""
Explanation:

1️⃣ We create a variable `message` and assign it a string value.
2️⃣ The `print(message)` statement displays the content stored in the variable.

✅ Key concepts in this exercise:
   - **Variable assignment:** A variable stores a string (text).
   - **Printing variables:** Using `print()` to display the stored value.

📌 Since the value of `message` is not changed in this script, it will always print the same output. 
However, if we assign a new value to `message` before printing again, the output will change accordingly.

🔎 This is a fundamental concept in Python and helps build a strong foundation for working with variables.
