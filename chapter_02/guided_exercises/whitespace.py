Explanation:

1Ô∏è‚É£ `\n` (newline) moves text to the next line, making outputs more readable.
2Ô∏è‚É£ `\t` (tab) adds an indentation, useful for formatting lists.
3Ô∏è‚É£ The first print statement prints `"Python"` followed by a blank line.
4Ô∏è‚É£ The second print statement prints `"Python"` with an indentation.
5Ô∏è‚É£ The third print statement prints a list of languages, each on a new line.
6Ô∏è‚É£ The fourth print statement prints the same list, but with indentation for better presentation.

‚úÖ Key concepts in this exercise:
   - **Escape sequences (`\n` and `\t`)** for formatting output.
   - **Newline (`\n`)** to print text on separate lines.
   - **Tab (`\t`)** to add indentation for structured output.

üìå These formatting techniques are useful for printing structured data like menus, tables, and reports.
